This set up demonstrates setting up Kubernetes on EC2 arm64-based
instances. Much thanks to Kelsey Hightower for putting together the
excellent [[https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way][Kubernetes the Hard Way]] tutorial on which it's based (I made
as few changes as I could figure out how). I mostly did this for my
own learning so I'm not sure anyone else will find it useful.
